# Number Manipulator Report

## About Number Manipulator Report

This is a project I made for my computer programming class using C++.
This project was created within the first few weeks of my class and
is very simple and follows exactly what my professor wanted. I am
limited on the techniques and methods I can use based on what we 
have covered in our class textbook. This assignment is coming 
from my second lab for the semester.

The application takes the users input of two positive double digit
numbers and produces a report of the maniuplated numbers.

## Getting Started

This is a standalone application, no installation is required.

1. Download the file
> [Click to Download](https://github.com/ant-cantu/Number-Manipulator-Report/blob/main/NumberManipulatorReport.exe)

2. Run the application.
3. Enter two positive numbers following the rules displayed.
4. Review the output.

## Usage

The purpose of this program is to take two seperate numerical values 
and break them down. First by simply finding the sum, difference,
product, and quotient of the two. Second by finding the same values 
but in Integer format. Lastly, finding the values once again but in
decimal format.

It is assumed that the user will enter two numeric values as there
are no input validation checks. I was limited on what I could use
in the application at this point and made exactly what the professor
was looking for.
